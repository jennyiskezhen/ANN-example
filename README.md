In this example, I used ANN to forecast voting results of the United State elections on the country level in 2016. Economic and Sociological factors were used when making the predictions on the voting results. 

I compared ANN solutions to several other basic machine learning models including k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM) learning methods.
